/**
 * # AWS Report Receiver
 *
 * ## Description
 *
 * Provisions receipt and ETL pipeline for one of the supported report types
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Resources:
 * TODO
 *
 * ```hcl
 * module "example" {
 *   source = "dod-iac/example/aws"
 *
 *   tags = {
 *     Project     = var.project
 *     Application = var.application
 *     Environment = var.environment
 *     Automation  = "Terraform"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Testing
 *
 * Run all terratest tests using the `terratest` script.  If using `aws-vault`, you could use `aws-vault exec $AWS_PROFILE -- terratest`.  The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is required by the tests.  Use `TT_SKIP_DESTROY=1` to not destroy the infrastructure created during the tests.  Use `TT_VERBOSE=1` to log all tests as they are run.  Use `TT_TIMEOUT` to set the timeout for the tests, with the value being in the Go format, e.g., 15m.  The go test command can be executed directly, too.
 *
 * ## Terraform Version
 *
 * Pin module version to ~> 1.0.0 . Submit pull-requests to master branch.
 *
 * Terraform 0.11 and 0.12 are not supported.

 *
 * ## Developer Setup
 *
 * This template is configured to use aws-vault, direnv, go, pre-commit, terraform-docs, and tfenv.  If using Homebrew on macOS, you can install the dependencies using the following code.
 *
 * ```shell
 * brew install aws-vault direnv go pre-commit terraform-docs tfenv
 * pre-commit install --install-hooks
 * ```
 *
 * If using `direnv`, add a `.envrc.local` that sets the default AWS region, e.g., `export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-west-2`.
 *
 * If using `tfenv`, then add a `.terraform-version` to the project root dir, with the version you would like to use.
